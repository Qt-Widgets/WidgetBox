* Style category button (or panel) closer to Qt Creator (Designer) look 
  or like to LibreOffice Writer Properties Tool Box on the right side

* Improve pages behaviour in Qt Designer similar to QToolBox: 
  now Designer does not change currentPageIndex PROPERTY and focus on page or category click for some reason
  
* Improve pages geometry resizing to content and their layout on design time and on run-time:
  QtreeWidget automatically increases itemWidget size height (in runtime, not design time - 
  it remains terrible there) if contents is bigger than widget (page) height, however if size 
  (sizeHint) is bigger - it does not decrease size to necessary minimum.

Hope for community help on these improvements.
